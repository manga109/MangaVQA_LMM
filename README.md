# MangaVQA and MangaLMM

This is the repository that contains source code for the [MangaVQA and MangaLMM project website](https://atsumiyai.github.io/mangalmm_vqa/).

## Project Description

We present **MangaVQA**, a benchmark of 526 manually constructed question–answer pairs designed to evaluate an LMM's ability to accurately answer targeted, factual questions grounded in both visual and textual context. We also develop **MangaLMM**, a manga-specialized version of Qwen2.5-VL, finetuned to jointly address both VQA and OCR tasks.
